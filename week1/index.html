   <h3>Reading: Instructions on Creating a Portfolio</h3>
   <ul>
    I have already created a portfolio in my previous corse but it wasnt dynamic. It was a bit challenging for me to write js code but that video from the instructor really came handy.
    I already had a github account so setting it up wasn't a problem.
   </ul>
   <h3>Reading: Doing stuff with web things</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>
      Reading through HTML and CSS at this level was a revision for me but my attention was specifically on localStorage.
    </li>
      <h3>Questions:</h3>
      <li>
        How long can the localStorage object store the key-value pairs in it? How long can the localStorage object store the key-value pairs in it? Is that the case?
      </li> 
    </ul>
    
      <h3>Master Mobile UX (SitePoint)</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>
        When designing a webpage, do mobile first (start small and scale up)
      </li>
      <li>
        Speed matters; reduce image usage throughout sites/ apps. Use SVG/webfonts which have lower bandwidth
      </li>
      <li>Optmize and minify CSS and JS files</li>
      <li>GZIPfiles to eliminate unnecessary data</li>
      <li>Focus on the important things first when asking for user input</li>
      <li>Content should come first! If using ads make them small and simple. Stop using pop-ups</li>

    </ul>
