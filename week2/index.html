   <ul>JavaScript has 7 different data types. 6 of which are primitive data types and are listed below
    <li>String</li>
    <li>Symbol</li>
    <li>Number</li>
    <li>Booleans</li>
    <li>Undefined</li>
    <li>Null</li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    Variables:
Valuables are used to refer to a value stored in memory
<br>
Declaring and assigning:
<br>
Variables have to be declared before they can be used. From ES6 onwards, JavaScript uses the keywords const and let to declare variables.
The keyword const is used when the variable will not be reassigned to another value.
<br>
WHEREAS The keyword let is used if the variable might be reassigned later in the program.
TO assign a value to a constant or variable, we use the = operator.

<li>Arrays, Logic, and Loops</li>
<li>sets</li>
<p>A set is a data structure that represents a collection of unique values. It can't include duplicates. They offer a useful way to keep track of data without having to check if any values have been duplicated.</p>
<li>Maps</li>
<p>A map is a bit like a dictionary where you can look up a value based on the key. To look up a value, we can use the get() method:
  <br>
  The has() method can be used to check if a particular key is in a map. This returns a boolean value of true or false:
  <br>
  A map can be created with multiple values by using a nested array as a parameter:
  <br>
  The number of key and value pairs in a map can be found by querying the size property:
