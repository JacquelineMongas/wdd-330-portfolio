            <h3>OBJECTS:</h3>
            <p>
                &bull; To create an object literal, simply enter a pair of curly braces.
                <br>Its also possible to create an object using a constructor function.This method is not recommended,
                however, and the object literal notation is the preferred way of creating objects.
                <br>&bull; ES6 provided a shorthand method of creating objects if a property key is the same as a
                variable name that the property value is assigned to
            <p>&bull; Access the properties of an object using the dot notation</p>
            <p>&bull; To call an object's method use dot or bracket notation; parentheses need to be placed after the
                method name</p>
            <p>&bull; An object literal can be passed as a parameter to a function</p>
            <p>&bull; Naming collisions occur when the same variable or function name is used for different purposes; a
                solution to this problem is to use the object literal pattern to create a namespace for groups of
                related functions. This is done by creating an object literal that serves as the namespace, then adding
                any values as properties of that object, and any functions as methods</p>
            <h3>Json</h3>
            <p>&bull; JSON is a string representation of the object literal notation
                <br>The beauty of JSON is that it manages to hit the sweet spot between being both human- and
                machine-readable
            </p>
            <p>&bull; (g) The global property makes the pattern return all matches. By default, the pattern only looks
                for the first occurrence of a match</p>
            <p>&bull; (i) The ignoreCase property makes the pattern case-insensitive. By default, they are case
                sensitive</p>
            <p>&bull; (m) The multiline property makes the pattern multiline. By default, a pattern will stop at the end
                of a line</p>
            <h3>The Document Object Model (DOM)</h3>
            <p>&bull; The DOM provides several methods that allow us to access any element on a page. These methods will
                return a node object or a node list, which is an array-like object. These objects can then be assigned
                to a variable and be inspected or modified</p>
            <p>&bull; The document object has a createElement() method that takes a tag name as a parameter and returns
                that element</p>
            <p>&bull; While it may seem useful to be able to edit the styles of elements on the fly, it is much better
                practice to dynamically change the class of an element and keep the relevant styles for each class in a
                separate stylesheet</p>
            <p>&bull; Event listeners are like setting a notification to alert you when something happens</p>

            <li>Questions</li>
            <p>
                After deleting an object, is it definitive or can we trieve it?
            </p>
