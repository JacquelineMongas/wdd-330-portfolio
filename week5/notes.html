        <h1>Week 5 Notes</h1>
        <section>
            <h3>Testing and Debugging:</h3>
            <h3>Errors, Exceptions, and Warnings</h3>
            <p>
                <b>System error</b> -There's a problem with the system or external devices with which the program is
                interacting.
                <br>
                <b>Programmer error </b> -There the program contains incorrect syntax or faulty logic; it could even be
                as simple as
                a typo.
                <br>
                <b>User error</b> ― The user has entered data incorrectly, which the program is unable to handle.
                <br>
                <b>Exception</b>
                <br> exception is an error that produces a return value that can then be used by the
                program to deal with the error <br>
                Stack Trace can be very helpful - you can follow the listing to trace where the problem lies <br>
                Warnings - warning can occur if there's an error in the code that isn't enough to cause the program
                to crash <br>
                &bull; this can be a problem if the program runs incorrectly but still runs <br>
                Because it is loosely typed some errors can slip through the code, you can enforce a strict mode ->
                'use strict'; <br>
                &bull; this will make it throw an exception instead of a warning (if the engine will accept the mode)
                <br>
                In can be used in a function or a strict function that will run the whole program code.
            </p>

            <h3>Linting</h3>
            <p>
                Linting Tools</b> <br>
                options to use linting tools help when enforcing a style guide, it will help catch errors live but won't
                necessarily guarantee anything. <br>
                ESLint inthis article on SitePoint -
                https://www.sitepoint.com/up-and-running-with-eslint-the-pluggable-javascript-linter/. <br>
                Feature detectors are best implemented in an if statement - therefore only running if it is capable.
                <br>
                if (window.holoDeck) { <br>
                virtualReality.activate(); <br>
                } <br>
            </p>

            <h3>Debugging</h3>
            <p>
                <b> Debugging in the browser</b> is my favorite way of checking how things work, and when they are
                implemented, even why they don't. <br>
                The book says the 'trusty alert is the basic form of debugging' however, I like console.log(); and
                debugger; <br>
                <br>
            </p>

            <h3>Error Objects</h3>
            <p>
                <b>EvalError:</b> is not used in the current ECMAScript specification and only retained for backwards
                compatibility. It was used to identify errors when using the global eval() function.<br>
                RangeError is thrown when a number is outside an allowable range of values.<br>
                ReferenceError is thrown when a reference is made to an item that doesn't exist. For example, calling a
                function that hasn't been defined.<br>
                SyntaxError is thrown when there's an error in the code's syntax.<br>
                TypeError is thrown when there's an error in the type of value used; for example, a string is used when
                a number is expected.<br>
                URIError is thrown when there's a problem encoding or decoding the URI.<br>
                InternalError is a non-standard error that is thrown when an error occurs in the JavaScript engine. A
                common cause of this too much recursion.<br>
                const error = new Error(); Constructor function to create and the parameter is the error message ->
                const error = new Error("oops, something isn't right"); <br>
                <br> there are errors that are thrown automatically by the JavaScript engine when an error occurs. It's
                also possible to throw your own exceptions using the throw statement <br>
                throw new Error('Something has gone badly wrong!'); <br>
                This example shows the error to be efficient in explaining the problem - not just NaN <br><br>
                function squareRoot(number) <br>
            </p>
